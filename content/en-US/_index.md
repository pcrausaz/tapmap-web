Pubs used to be the social cornerstone of our culture and one of the great melting pots for the community. But in recent years many are being priced out of their local boozer. 

Corporate greed and ill-thought legislation are squeezing young people with higher and higher living costs, and the rising cost of a simple pint is far outpacing the rate of inflation. News media search for scapegoats for the death of city centre nightlife, whilst ignoring the root cause of it - it is simply becoming unaffordable for many to enjoy a night out in town.
